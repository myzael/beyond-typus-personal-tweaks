The research is based off a lot of things.
One thing of note is that Georgian coins were minted from copper. This would indicate copper mines in the area.
Another source claims lead was used as a currency as well. Likely because of the silver famine in the middle east.

A lot of grain was produced in the region apparently. This has been confirmed by a lot of sources, and one source in particular is interesting, though it is merely a blog.

According to the above, Georgia was barely trading, and the economy "survived on agriculture".
Even then, it appears Genoese traders only traded in agriculture.
There's also a slip of interest about the Georgian Kingdom "restoring trade", but not what trade was restored.

This map was found, unfortunately from 1918 Georgia:  https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcwdl.wdl_15666/

Thus, the following declarations were decided upon:
7298: Naval supplies (Forested, lumber)
7295: Silver (But just as easily, naval supplies for lumber).
7293: Copper (But just as easily, livestock)
7294: Stays grain
7292: Stays grain
7289: Livestock
7290: Stays grain
7291: Fruit
7297: Stays grain
7296: Stays grain
7299: Wine (Maybe not entirely historical but it's better than another grain province.)
