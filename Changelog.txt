	- Absolutism now reducing estate loyalty equilibrium by up to -20% at 100 absolutism
	- Seizing land now incurs a -20%/-15% estate loyalty equilibrium malus for 5 years

	- An overhaul to governing capacity & corruption modifiers

	- The ability to pick between each and every estate's agenda in diets (Somewhat done by vanilla, but in a roundabout breakable way)
- (Dub) Integrated the More Buildings addon to BT16, with almost all its features & tweaks. Included, but not limited to:
	- New buildings for navy, military, production, taxation, as well as new manufactories and other governance buildings such as roads and canals.
	- Some buildings have been reworked, as area-wide buildings were cut and remade into other types of buildings such as alternate manufactories.
	- Vanilla's temple building is also no longer the tax building, now increasing missionary strength and decreases culture conversion cost in the province.

	- Conquest missions spanning Siberia, Russia, Ruthenia, Poland, Finland, Baltics, Pontic Steppes as well as Caucasia.
	- Flavour missions expanding akin to what the Russian Domination tree does, focusing on internal matters of Ruthenia such as production, religion, development, estates, court, army (Streltsy + Cossacks) and more.
	- The mission tree results in mechanics available to Russia becoming available to Ruthenia as well in some ways, such as the Finnish PU subject, the Serfdom chain, as well as government reforms.
- (Harbivore) Added a new mechanic: Development Points
	- This mechanic replaces the use of monarch points to develop provinces. 
	- Dev Points are only ever directly generated from buildings, they are modified by several factors on a provincial level and a national level. Examples are: -being at peace -ideas -90% manpower -prosperity -overextension
	- They are spent in the same way monarch points were previously used
	- There is a maximum amount that can be stored at once, changed by gov rank, ideas and adm tech. If a nation goes over their limit they are automatically spent.
- (Harbivore) Added silver as a tradegood.
	- Existing gold provinces throughout the world were considered and looked over to see whether they produced silver or gold.
- (Harbivore) Added a Mines of Upper Hungary goods produced modifier in the Upper Hungary Area (Modern Slovakia), improving the Hungarian economy.
- (Dub) Created 10 (11) additional buttons, present in the Country Court screen, that allows you to spend excess monarch points to gain countrywide modifiers.

#Bugfixes

 - (Dub) Fixed bug with duplicate BEI_ideas 
 - (Dub) Fixed vanilla localisation bug where locked reform tooltip would not draw new line

 - (Dub) Fixed the in-game menu, accessed by pressing Escape.
 - (Dub) Semi-fixed the readability of the modifiers that apply for different subjects by adding spacing between different modifiers.
	- Note that this cannot be properly fixed without writing massive amounts of custom localisation, as the game does not procure localisation when checking for government abilities.
 - (Harbivore) Fixed error with American dynamic CoT events
 - (Dub) Fixed SRN_ADJ & EGL_ADJ localisation, again (?)
 - (Dub) Fixed duplicate Penang & Barus provinces
 - (Dub) Bandaid-fixed vanilla tooltip bug for subject bonuses (It's still buggy, but without custom-tooltipping the entire thing, there's no fix for it)

 - (Dub) Fixed favour cost for returning core provinces from allies not taking dev-doubling into account
 - (Dub) Delagified the endgame tag trigger such that it's about twice as fast to calculate, thereby reducing overall game lag.
	- Note that this new system is much more prone to break, depending on setting country flags which may disappear in edge-case scenarios. Please be prudent to report these to us!
 - (Dub) Delagified the vanilla Indian Trade Company decision such that it's about 5 times as fast to calculate, thereby reducing overall game lag.

#Tweaks and Balance
 - (JP) Provinces removed from Anatolia, Levant, and Mesopotamia, to help with density and development balance
 - (Dub) Tweaked Expand Infrastructure + Centralize State 
 - (Dub) Removed BT's Japanese monuments with no modifiers for now. They may get re-added someday, but AI is now capable of upgrading great projects and them being there would hurt Japanese AI nations 
 - (Dub) Cut all mentions of flat institution growth in vanilla, replacing them with varying levels of institution spread modifiers 
 - (Dub) Changed Goslar's trade good from iron to copper (Vanilla issue) to reflect the mine not producing any ferrous metals 
 - (Dub) Base sailors from provinces are now doubled, from 15 to 30, to account for vanilla's change from 30 to 60 at some point.
 - (Dub) Adjusted Great Powers' crownland share at game start
 - (Dub) Added strong duchies to several nations lacking it
 - (Velius) Cut Alawite and Druze religions
 - (Dub) Lowered base vassal FL contribution from +2 to +1 due to them already giving +10% of their FL to their overlord, causing nations such as Bohemia to have 10 more FL than they ought to.
 - (Harbivore) Changed the Teutonic disaster and added a new cb only in that war that is 50% cost and ae. Also reduced the amount of provinces that is ceded to Danzig
 - (Harbivore) Changed chances of Ai forming personal unions in events. They are more likely to take it, but if they still decline there is a big incentive to do so and the other nation will get a CB of reclaim personal union. So maybe Poland will be Lithuania's PU instead
 - (Harbivore) Added +0.5 yearly tax per state in the HRE for the Emperor so if the Emperorship goes to a small nation they should still be pretty formidable
 - (Harbivore) Removed several silk provinces at game start.
 - (Harbivore) Set Bohemia's AI personality to be mostly diplomat in the hopes it stops their bloodlust
 - (Harbivore) Set Mamluk's AI personality to be mostly diplomat to show the state being too nonchalant about the turkish threat. This will help BT ottomans who were struggling
 - (Harbivore) Reremove the Welsh-English historic rivalry, but if Wales is ever independent they get it back. They also start with 10 trust with England at game start and a +25 liberty disire for "Discontent with English Rule"
 - (Harbivore) Changed trade good in belgrade to dyes. Cinnabar production
 - (Harbivore & Dub) Added Coal in a few provinces in Italy (Sulcis) and Iberia (Carmona)
 - (Dub) Removed Cordoban gold - there was no evidence to suggest the Sierra Morenas were properly mined in Spain. All evidence pointed towards romans & arabs. In fact, the area was *very* rural during the Spaniards.
 - (Dub) Added +20% breakthrough to cav units. For anyone not aware: Breakthrough is a mechanic disabled in vanilla where when defeating a front row unit in combat, it has a chance of pulling the artillery behind it to the front row. This chance is 0% in vanilla by default. BT now changes this to 0% for infantry and 20% for cavalry in an attempt to promote cav usage later game.
 - (Dub) Rebalanced AI building code such that the AI will finally be more intelligent in their build order, making it much less willing to spend on forcelimit buildings and more focused on economic buffs.
 - (Dub) Re-added CoT to Trondelag (PROV20)
 - (Dub) Tweaked Lusitania, Spain & Andalusia formable such that you can circumvent the clause of none of the other existing by having more provinces than them.
 - (Dub) Tweaked Defender of Faith modifiers and num of nations following the faith such that same faith nations get more modifiers, and the defender of faith being more oriented towards amassing large armies rather than more professional ones and a bunch of other things. Certain modifiers were cut, and others were introduced, attempting to hearken back to Misc changes made by Draiocht.
 - (Hadiros) Changed Lusitania to blue to match vanilla Portugal change.
 - (Hadiros) Gave Tlemcen a different shade of green to the old Portugal green.
 - (Hadiros) Added Nestorian and Apostolic to Burghers Orthodox Tolerance Privilege.
 - (Dub) Tweaked Corruption & Over Governing Capacity such that the minimum province autonomy was shuffled over to being over govcap.
 - (Dub) Shifted Wolgast CoT to Stettin - it deserved it, being a major hanseatic city and the capital of Pomerania, whereas Wolgast simply was not a trade city.
 - (Dub) Shuffled Wild Fields coal provinces into the Donets basin 
 - (Dub) Tweaked Governing Capacity - now government ranks grant 0/25/50% extra governing capacity instead of a flat bonus, and governing capacity from tech has been smudged over all admin technologies.
 - (Dub) Tweaked Warscore impact from province autonomy to be more impactful - provinces with high autonomy should now be much cheaper to conquer.
 - (Harbivore) Changed dutch polders to be more appropriate.
 - (Harbivore) Made Genoa and Venice Historical rivals to stop their monopoly on the seas.
 - (Harbivore) Gave a failure condition to castilian disaster if the rebels win allowing them to escape the disaster.
 - (Harbivore) Made Sicily a PU of Aragon to simultaneously fix an ahistoric issue and keep Aragonese subjects loyal
 - (Harbivore) Changed Sicilian Colours to be a nice orange
 - (Harbivore) Made Naples and the Papal states historical friends to show friendship between them and Alfonds
 - (Dub) Tweaked the coring system:
	- Coring time has now been increase to 10 years.
	- Separatism now increases minimum autonomy by 3% per year of separatism. I.e, a freshly conquered province has 90% autonomy floor from separatism.
	- Territorial cores now cost 25% of the admin points instead of 50%.
	- Overextension has now been overhauled to signify the troubles of pacifying newly conquered regions, instead of being mostly diplomatically focused.
 - (Dub) Cut KoK Pronoiar creation making the country leader a "greek general" - it makes no sense.
 - (Dub) Tweaked native policies such that trading with natives gives twice the production from natives, and returned other native policies to vanilla's values.
 - (Dub) Shuffled Glass tradegood from Linköping to Nyköping to reflect history and added the Sala Silver Mine in Västerås.
 - (Dub) Doubled MTTH on PurelyNasty event (Separatist Sentiment) to account for more provinces.
 - (Dub) Mamluks now start with a Mamluk Decadence Nobility privilege which'll hurt their mil tech advancements (Apparently their Mamluks refused to introduce gunpowder into their ranks).
 
#Localised Naming
 - (JP) Full localised naming in South Caucusia for Georgian, Armenian, Turkish, Russian, and Byzantine, plus some Persian, Kurdish, and Tatar

 - (Harbivore) Changed Poland's vassalisation of danzig to be more historical and interesting
 - (Harbivore) Changed Austrian mission where you had to conquer bishoprics to instead make vanilla Austrian borders
 - (Harbivore) Made it so if Castile/Spain kicks out the Andalusi through missions or events they will lose their silk provinces in the region. (Don't deport the people making your goods, they turn to naval supplies. (The locals ended up burning the mulberry trees for firewood.))
