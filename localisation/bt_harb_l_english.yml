 bt_silk_events.1.title:0 "Murcian Silk production"
 bt_silk_events.1.disc:0 "After the Reconquista and the fall of Andalusi control in Murcia, silk production was disrupted to the point that the region was almost exclusively producting raw silk and no refined fabrics. Even this silk production, was only done on a small scale and produced low quality raw silk. Around the end of the 1400s there was an increase in production and a true industry creating raw silk was made. This was the result of a change in how the spinners were paid and also the introduction of the white mulberry tree to the region. Finally, there was an ordinance introduced which helped to organise the silk industry."

 bt_silk_events.2.title:0 "Bologna Silk Mills"
 bt_silk_events.2.disc:0 "Around the mid 15th Century Bologna was the first place to use hydraulic silk mills to refine the silk into threads. Also, thanks to an extensive network of underground waterways, they were the place they became the most persuasive and they built a great many hydraulic silk mills. They continued to improve apon these designs and eventually developed a fully mechanised silk mill. This allowed them to create high quality silk with very little intervention from the workers. The design and working of the hydraulic silk mill was a closely guarded secret and there was at least two artisans that were put to death as a result of being suspected of having leaked it's secrets."

They continued to improve apon these designs and eventually developed a fully mechanised silk mill. This allowed them to create high quality silk with very little intervention from the workers. We have tried for a long time to aquire these secrets and finally we have the designs of their silk mills and we can start using it to boost our silk production."

 bt_silk_events.8.title:0 "Creating a French Silk Industry"
 bt_silk_events.8.disc:0 "With the burgeoning Italian silk industry France made a second attempt to start a silk industry in Lyon. They did this by granting the city of Lyon a monoploy on silk production. Lyon then grew to become the capital of silk production in europe, they started to move away from the Arabic styles and created their own style of dress. The question we must ask ourselves if we should create a centralised industry or to spread silk production to all the corners of France."
