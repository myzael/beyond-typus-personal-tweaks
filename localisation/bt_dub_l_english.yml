Several [From.GetNoblemenPoliticians] in our court suggest that [Root.GetCapitalName] should be declared a charter, formally stating the city's importance in trade."

 mag_magdeburgization:0 "A Swift Recovery"
 mag_magdeburgization:0 "The City of Magdeburg is notorious for many things, one of them being its swift recovery. During the Thirty Years War, the city found itself besieged by the Catholic league and refused to surrender, hoping for the Protestant Swedes to lift its siege. Unfortunately, help did not reach the city in time, and as a result, over 80% of its inhabitants were slaughtered and raped by its attackers. This event, known as the Sacking of Magdeburg, has coined the term \"Magdeburgization\", meaning total destruction.\n\nIt did not take long however for the city to once again prosper, however, as its Burgmeister and scientist Otto von Guericke amassed personal wealth as a brewer which he himself spent on restoring the city to its former glory. While it did not reach its prior importance until much later, it served as an important stepping stone towards that recovery."

 mag_magdeburg_hemispheres_desc:0 "Otto von Guericke was not only the Burgmeister of the city of Magdeburg, but also a great scientist and physicist. Shortly after its sacking, in 1656, the city were to house what may be the most famous scientific experiment of the 17th century - the Magdeburg Hemispheres. With them, Otto von Guericke coined the concept of atmospheric pressure and, with an air pump, the existence of vacuum. Being unable to be torn apart by even the power of thirty horses, the Magdeburg Hemispheres were a marvellous demonstration of the powers of science and invention."
