Mechanical overhaul: Cores
The issues:
1. Conquering provinces is too damn powerful.
2. Once a province is cored, it immediately benefits your nation massively.
3. Overextension never plays a part except the game-y "Gotta stay below 100% overextension to avoid bad events"
4. Nations never bounce back from having their lands conquered - they just die: Lost lands makes them very weak, the nation that conquered the land has grown massively stronger.
5. Admin points are massively overvalued - and frankly necessary because of this mechanic.
6. Core creation cost is almighty because admin points are so overvalued

PDX's solution to counter fast expansion: Increase AE such that coalitions are the way to take down fast expanders.

Mechanical changes: 
-Remove coring cost of territories.
	6. This removes a major power spike in the core creation cost modifier - thus breaking a powerful meta of the modifier being massively overpowered in the game.
	5. This also reduces the value of admin points massively.
-Make state cores not possible to create in provinces with separatism.
	4. This solves the issue of nations conquering land growing massively stronger - the province gives very small bonuses to the nation that conquered it, and only really gain prominence later down the line, 30 years after the fact.
	1. This buffs vassalisation quite a bit, because you can theoretically create a core earlier by vassalising a nation. In return, you have to pay diplo points.
	2. This means newly conquered provinces are a lot less valuable initially to a nation.
-Up base coring time to 120 months.
	6. This means that core creation cost reduces coring time a lot more. Which is now a lot more valuable, leaving core creation cost a powerful modifier, but less so an end all modifier.
	3. This means that overextension's modifiers, such as yearly corruption and national unrest, cause tangible effects over a long period for nations that conquer lands quickly.
	1. In addition, years of separatism now becomes a lot more powerful, because you will now have tangible effects from separatism and unrest, thereby weakening the conquering of provinces.
-Remove 100+% overextension bad events.
	3. This means that countries are not hard-stopped from expanding, but instead will feel the negative effects of fast expansion.
-Adjust overextension modifiers to be more tailored towards rebel suppression modifiers, using your military might to establish authority.
	-50% manpower recovery speed at 100%
	-Add +25% subject LD at 100%
	-Add +50% diplomatic annexation cost at 100%
	-Keep unrest
	-Keep corruption
	-Keep stab cost	
-This means we can reduce the base AE gain, thereby fixing the issues that comes with PDX's solution to fast expansion.

How does this affect monarch point generation?
-Currently, admin points are generated en masse in order to accomodate expansion by coring. Admin points are one of the least versatile monarch points.
-This would allow the reduction of base monarch point generation by at least 1, potentially even more, because point 5 has now been solved.

With the development points system in place, the following should be adjusted:
